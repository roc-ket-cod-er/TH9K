## TH9K
A 9-key Macro pad with 6 LEDs, an OLED and a rotary encoder designed to go under the space bar so your thumbs too can feel useful.

## BOM
- 9x KeyBoard switch
- 9x Diodes
- 6x RGB LED
- Some kind of screws, probably M3
- 1x 0.91" 128x32 OLED Display
- 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 1x Case

In other words, I have used 9 keyboard switches, a rotary encoder, and an OLED. The OLED goes under the big rectangualar hole, the rotary encoder in the left squarish one, the leds will be visible throught the right square hole, and the main switches and stuff in the last hole as shown below:
